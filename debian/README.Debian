Vdsm for Debian
===============

Notable changes from upstream:

- Vdsm hooks are not enabled by their simple presence.  You must enable them by
  linking them to corresponding subdirectories in /etc/vdsm/hooks/.

- Core dumps are handled with the aid of `corekeeper' package, you can find
  them in /var/crash/vdsm/.
