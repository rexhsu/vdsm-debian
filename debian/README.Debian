Vdsm for Debian
===============

Notable changes from upstream:

- Core dumps are handled with the aid of `corekeeper' package, you can find
  them in /var/crash/vdsm/.

- Extra hooks are not provided.  Most of those extra hooks are unmaintained
  and/or their functionality is available without them.  If you still need some
  of them, you can take and install them from the source package.
